# Lesson #1 - Setup & Intro to Dart
Welcome to Scope Spring 2019! This semester we'll be learning the Flutter, which is Google's mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native experiences on both iOS and Android. 

## Setup
The first thing we need to do is set up our development environment. There are a couple of different options for this but we'll be following along with Google's recommended setup which is using Android Studio. The official steps for setup are here -

You can download Android Studio here (https://developer.android.com/studio/) if you don't already have it installed.

Android Studio doesn't come with Flutter and Dart out of the box so we'll need to install the necessary plugins. 

To do this follow these steps:
Start Android Studio.
* Open plugin preferences (Preferences > Plugins on macOS, File > Settings > Plugins on Windows & Linux).
* Select Browse repositories, select the Flutter plugin and click Install.
* Click Yes when prompted to install the Dart plugin.
* Click Restart when prompted.


## Intro to Dart
Flutter is built using the programming language Dart which was just released last year. In order to jump into building Flutter apps, first we'll need to learn a bit about how Dart works.
